Final Variables
However, you can add the final keyword 
if you don't want others (or yourself) to overwrite existing values (this will declare the variable as "final" or "constant", which means unchangeable and read-only):

package com.company;
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.Date;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
	// write your code here~
        //use final to make a variable into constant
        final float pi = 10;

    }}
