There is also a "for-each" loop, which is used exclusively to loop through elements in an array:

for (type variableName : arrayName) {
  // code block to be executed
}


//Use for each to loop through the array

public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args){
    String [] cars= {"Volvo", "BM", "Ford", "Mazda"};
    for (String i : cars){
      System.out.println(i);
    }
  }
}
