-Every line of code that runs in Java must be inside a class.
-class should have name start with Uppercase
-The name of the java file must match the class name
-The main() method is required and you will see it in every Java program:
-When saving the file, save it using the class name and add ".java" to the end of the filename. 

System.out.println()
Inside the main() method, we can use the println() method to print a line of text to the screen:

class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args){
 System.out.println("Hello world");
  }
}
