A method is a block of code which only runs when it is called.

You can pass data, known as parameters, into a method.

Methods are used to perform certain actions, and they are also known as functions.

public class Main {
  static void myMethod() {
    // code to be executed
  }
}

myMethod() is the name of the method
static means that the method belongs to the Main class and not an object of the Main class. 
void means that this method does not have a return value. You will learn more about return values later in this chapter

//Call method
public class Main {
  static void myMethod() {
    System.out.println("I just got executed!");
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    myMethod();
  }
}
